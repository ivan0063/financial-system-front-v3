- On fixed expense catalog when I create a new one It won't refresh the component can you fit it?

- On Fixed Expense view the field Monthly Cost should able to set a double number

- On fixed expense creation it fails I see that its creating the following request 

{
    "name": "test222",
    "monthlyCost": 544,
    "paymentDay": 14,
    "active": true,
    "debtSysUser": null,
    "fixedExpenseCatalog": "/jpa/fixedExpenseCatalog/undefined"
}

And it should be:

{
    "name": "test222",
    "monthlyCost": 544,
    "paymentDay": 14,
    "active": true,
    "debtSysUser": /jpa/user/jimm0063@gmail.com,
    "fixedExpenseCatalog": "/jpa/fixedExpenseCatalog/test2"
}

Where 

jimm0063@gmail.com = default email in the project
test2 = code selected Category * form

Error: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'provider.financialProviderCatalog.name')
